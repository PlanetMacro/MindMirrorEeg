=============

Portable 2 channel EEG with Cade/Blundell bandpass filters.

<br>2) Keeping the power manageable to use replaceable batteries
<br>3) Using an LCD module to provide visual information of the output of 14 channels.
<br>4) Communicating safely with a windows PC to show the details on a low cost PC display (circa 1992)
